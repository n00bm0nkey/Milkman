# Milkman
Ordering Platform for Collection &amp; Deliveries

## Overview
Milkman is an order management platform which will allow retailers to adapt and thrive under the current lockdown restrictions. Consumers will be able to order all the products they normally would have from their local vendors for collection & delivery. This empowers retailers which would have relied on customer footfall in their stores to operate solely with a digital presence.

## Goals
Application - Ordering System for Collections: Create an easy to use application which any vendor can use to display and sell items for collection.<br /> 
Application - Google Maps API integration for Deliveries: Integrate Google Maps API providing vendors with routes.<br />
